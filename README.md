# Mapping between different kinematic structures without absolute positioning during operation

## Objectives:

Dataset acquisition performed to the HANDLE project partner: Orebro University - AASS Learning Systems Lab.

To study the motion of the human thumb finger relatively to the rest of the hand. To move the hand through all possible movements of the thumb several times.

The acquired data was going to form a training set for an algorithm that learns the mapping from CyberGlove (human hand) values to SHADOW robotic hand joint angles, therefore it is important that the entire range of each joint is explored, and that there are as many samples as possible of as many different thumb positions as possibl
